# Data-Mining
This repo was created to track the project 'Predictive Segmentation of E-Commerce Customers' of Data Mining course. 

The Notebook folder contains the colab notebooks Project and Project accuracies where we have done the classification and compared different models and their accuracies.

The weights folder contains the pickle files for each model.
